    "Our project focuses on analyzing the nutrition breakdown in Guatemala by region (rural or urban) and, household size. We dive deep into demand for food within the groups broken down by the specified criteria and are focused on evaluating what kinds of policies might be effective at improving outcomes for particular populations with specific regards to nutritional staples. Typically, the food people choose to eat may be quite different from the foods that people should eat, from a nutritional perspective and our policies aim at closing the bag between the current nutritional consumption levels and the recommended levels of nutrient intake."
