EEP 153: Project 4 

Analyzing the nutrition breakdown in Guatemala by region (rural or urban) as well as, household size with families with less than 8 members being small families and more than 8 being considered large families. Our project dives on demand for food and is focused on evaluating what kinds of policies might be effective at improving outcomes for particular populations. Typically, the food people choose to eat may be quite different from the foods that people should eat, from a nutritional perspective.
