This README file is a general how-to for our group's Projects 4 in working with GitHub in EEP 153.
Our project files involving Jupyter Notebooks will be organized into folders in the main repository. These can be accessed within the files in the repository, each labeled with the contents of the file. 

Our project focuses on analyzing the nutrition breakdown in Guatemala by region (rural or urban) and, household size. We dive deep on demand for food within the groups broken down by the specified criteria, and is focused on evaluating what kinds of policies might be effective at improving outcomes for particular populations with specific regards to nutritional staples. Typically, the food people choose to eat may be quite different from the foods that people should eat, from a nutritional perspective and our policies aim on closing the bag between the current nutrional consumtion levels and the reccomended levels of nutrient intake.
